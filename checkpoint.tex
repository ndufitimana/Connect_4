\section{Project Goal}

The main goal of our project is apply adverserial search algorithms we have learned to an entirely new game. 
Specifically we will be applying MinMax and MCTS to Connect-4 board game and compare the performance of both algorithms
on the game.

\section{AI Methods Used}

Adverserial Searching Algorithms: 
Monte Carlo Tree Search
Depth Bounded Minimax

\section{Staged Development Plan}

Goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrating Connect-4 game to the existing board game interface to be able 
to apply the current implementation of the algorithms we have.

\item Successfully applying MCTS to Connect-4
\item Successfully applying Depth Bounded Minimax to Connect-4.

\item Successfully implement a basic static evaluator for Depth Bounded Minimax.

\item Successfully handle multiple games between MCTS and MinMax
\item Successfully handle multiple games between MinMax(both MinMax and Pruning)

\item Investigating the performance of various combinations of the algorithms as adversaries on the game.

Strech Goals:
\item Implement a better static evaluator for Depth Bounded Minimax 
\item Successfully saving the tree for MCTS using pickle or json.
\end{itemize}


\section{Measure of Success}


Successfully applying both MCTS and Depth Bounded Minimax to 
multiple games rounds of Connect-4 

\section{Plans for Analyzing Results}

We will graphically show the following analysis: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare the total games won by each algorithm by varying the algorithm's parameters
\item MCTS: vary the number of rollouts and hold paramaters of other games constant
\item Depth Bounded Minimax: vary the depth of the tree and change the static evaluator
\item Compare the performance of MCTS after saving the tree to Depth Bounded Minimax and Standard MCTS
\end{itemize}
